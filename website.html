        <h3>Ways that are caught:</h3>
       <p>Alaskan Salmon are either caught in a responsible manner or are farmed in large aquacultures. Farmers will make large areas of aquaculture in ponds or bodies of water where they will make hundreds of thousands of fish in order to ship out to eat. They are an abundant species to farm and catch, and if are eaten in a super responsible manner.
    </p>
    <h3>Is it ECO-friendly for your body?</h3>
    <p>Salmon is a very nutritious source of omega-3 and is low in contaminants due to the way that it is farmed and caught. It can be a replacement for Bluefin tuna and farmed Atlantic salmon. </p>
